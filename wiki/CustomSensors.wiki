====All Custom Sensors are now compiled for PRTG 8 and continued at [http://code.google.com/p/prtg-addons/wiki/PTF_Custom_Sensors this] page.=

What is changed?
 * All Custom Sensors now have unified errorhandling and help.
 * The username (-u) and password (-p) parameters have become optional for some sensors as PRTG 8 allows you to run a Custom Sensor with elevated credentials.
 * Most Custom Sensors are still backwards compatible with PRTG 7.
