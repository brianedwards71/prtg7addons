#summary PTF launcher: Have your PRTG Server launch external applications.
#sidebar KrijcoWikiSidebar

= Introduction =

PTF launcher is a Custom Notification that can launch external applications.

PRTG Server runs as a service and therefore cannot start applications that interact with the desktop.
With PTF Launcher, this is no longer an issue.


= Prerequisites =
PTF Launcher targets the .Net Framework 2.0 that comes with Windows update and is already included in the default installation of Windows 7.

= Installation =
The download includes two .exe files:
 * Launch.exe is the Custom Notification and needs to be copied to the *\Notifications\EXE* subfolder of your PRTG installation. 
 * Launcher.exe is a system tray application that needs to be started on your PRTG server.
The Launch.exe Custom Notification parses the details of the external application that needs to be started to the Launcher.exe tray application that actually starts the external application.

= Start the Launcher application =
Once the Launcher application is started, it will be visible in your system tray (next to the clock).

_For the launcher application to work, a user must always be logged into the computer running your PRTG Server._

*Tip:* Copy Launcher.exe to the startup folder of your PRTG Server to have it automatically started when your PRTG Server is restarting.

= Custom Notification =

In the parameter section of the Custom Notification you have to provide details about the application that has to be started.

Use the following parameters:

{{{
-s=	Application to start
-a=	Arguments for the application to start
-k=	Application to kill
}}}

For example:
{{{
-s=cmd -a=/K ipconfig /ALL
}}}
Will open a new command window with ipconfig

{{{
-k=cmd -s=cmd -a=/K ping %host
}}}
Will kill the existing command window and ping the sensors host in an a new command window

Please see the documentation that is included in the [Notifications download] for more details.
