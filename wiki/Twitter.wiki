= Introduction =

PTF Twitter sends notifications from PRTG to Twitter. 


If the text of a notification becomes too long, PTF Twitter breaks the text up and sends multiple notifications. While sending multiple notifications, the LIFO principal is used, producing a top-down readable tweet.

Using this command line syntax:
