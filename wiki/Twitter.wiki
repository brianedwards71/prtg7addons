If the text of a notification becomes too long, PTF Twitter breaks the text up and sends multiple notifications.

While sending multiple notifications, the LIFO principal is used, producing a top-down readable tweet.

Using this command line syntax:

{{{
-u=prtgtoolsfamily -p=password -l -t=Paessler has been at the forefront of providing
the industry's most powerful, affordable and easy-to-use network solutions since
