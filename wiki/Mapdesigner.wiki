= Introduction =
PTF Map Designer is a tool used to create background images for PRTG maps.
PTF Map Designer can be used as a transparent overlay over an existing PRTG map

= Details =

Start PTF Map Designer and position it over an existing PRTG map. Adjust the position and size of the drawing canvas to fit exactly over the PRTG map. Use the Transparency slider to make the canvas slightly transparent, so that you can see the objects of your PRTG map.
Now start drawing!
Place the various objects on the canvas, change their colors and drag them to the correct position.

Save your work as a “.png” file and use this file as a background image for your PRTG map.
As the PTF Map Designer was positioned over and scaled to the size of your PRTG map, it will fit like a glove.
